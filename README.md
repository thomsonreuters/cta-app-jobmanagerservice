**JobManager Data Service Application (JMS)**  for Compass Test Automation, implementing CTA-OSS Framework

## General Overview

### Overview
JobManager Data Service (JMS) performing as a brick between CTA-Execution-DataService(EDS) and CTA-Agent. JMS will receive commands from EDS. Then JMS will transform commands and send them to CTA-Agent(s). Many agents may receive these commands according to `mode` field.

For detail, please go to our [**CTA Main Repository**](https://github.com/thomsonreuters/cta).

### Features
  * __Mono mode__: send a command to single CTA-Agent. If there are many CTA-Agents matching the condition, first CTA-Agent will be chosen.
  * __Stress mode__: send a command to matching CTA-Agent. If there are many CTA-Agents matching the condition, JMS will send the same command to all.
  * __Group mode__: send a command to single CTA-Agent. If there are many CTA-Agents matching the condition, First, not-busy, CTA-Agent will pick up the command.
  * __Parallel mode__: send many commands to matching CTA-Agent. If there are many CTA-Agents matching the condition, Not-busy CTA-Agent(s) will help each other picking up the commands.
